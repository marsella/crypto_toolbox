\title{Shamir secret sharing}
\date{}
\maketitle

Choose a secret from a finite field over a prime $p$: $s \in F_p$

Define a random degree-$d$ polynomial $f$ over the field $F_p$ such that
\[ f(x) = f_d x^d + f_{d-1}x^{d-1} + \dots + f_1x + s \]

A share is a pair $(x_i, f(x_i))$. Collecting $d+1$ chares allows reinterpolation of $f$ (e.g., using Lagrange interpolation) such that you can extract the secret $s$.

Secrets are additively homomorphic (add two polynomials $\to$ get a new polynomial). They are multiplicatively homomorphic but this produces a degree $2d$ polynomial.
